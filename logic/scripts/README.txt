To use these scripts for setting up pulsar, make sure to configure pulsar-path.txt to the path to a local pulsar
installation, which contains a bin folder, which itself contains the pulsar-admin executable. Also, if pulsar is not
running on localhost, either edit the commands to use another hostname or set up port forwarding over SSH.
